Local middleware client to transfer music libraries from Apple Music to Spotify.

## Development

### Pre-requisites

- Nodejs >= 19.x.x
- Visual Studio
   - 2022 (this is what I have installed)   
   - UWP
   - Windows SDK v10.19401.0

### Recommended

- Editor: Visual Studio Code
- Something that runs Windows 10/11

### Getting Started

- Using [React Native Windows](https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/)
- Have a browser opened (Edge, Chrome, whatever)

```
npm install && npm run windows
```

If the universe is on your side, you should get a UWP running. Else, please read the error messages and bing/google it.
